    "\n",
    "This module wraps Open Spiel Python interface providing an RL-friendly API. It\n",
    "covers both turn-based and simultaneous move games. Interactions between agents\n",
    "and the underlying game occur mostly through the `reset` and `step` methods,\n",
    "which return a `TimeStep` structure (see its docstrings for more info).\n",
    "\n",
    "The following example illustrates the interaction dynamics. Consider a 2-player\n",
    "Kuhn Poker (turn-based game). Agents have access to the `observations` (a dict)\n",
    "field from `TimeSpec`, containing the following members:\n",
    " * `info_state`: list containing the game information state for each player. The\n",
    "   size of the list always correspond to the number of players. E.g.:\n",
    "   [[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]].\n",
    " * `legal_actions`: list containing legal action ID lists (one for each player).\n",
    "   E.g.: [[0, 1], [0]], which corresponds to actions 0 and 1 being valid for\n",
    "   player 0 (the 1st player) and action 0 being valid for player 1 (2nd player).\n",
    " * `current_player`: zero-based integer representing the player to make a move.\n",
    "\n",
    "At each `step` call, the environment expects a singleton list with the action\n",
    "(as it's a turn-based game), e.g.: [1]. This (zero-based) action must correspond\n",
    "to the player specified at `current_player`. The game (which is at decision\n",
    "node) will process the action and take as many steps necessary to cover chance\n",
    "nodes, halting at a new decision or final node. Finally, a new `TimeStep`is\n",
    "returned to the agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simultaneous-move games follow analogous dynamics. The only differences is the\n",
    "environment expects a list of actions, one per player. Note the `current_player`\n",
    "field is \"irrelevant\" here, admitting a constant value defined in spiel.h, which\n",
    "defaults to -2 (module level constant `SIMULTANEOUS_PLAYER_ID`).\n",
